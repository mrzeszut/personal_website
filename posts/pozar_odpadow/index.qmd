## PM10

Simulation results of the spread of PM10 suspended dust in the air from a hazardous waste fire. The animation shows the values of 1-hour PM10 concentrations at the ground surface caused by the impact of a hazardous waste fire. Simulations were carried out using the AERMOD model, recommended by the U.S. EPA for regulatory applications.

## BaP

Simulation results on the spread of B(a)P in air from a hazardous waste fire. The animation shows the values of 1-hour B(a)P concentrations at the ground surface caused by the impact of a hazardous waste fire. Simulations were carried out using the AERMOD model, recommended by the U.S. EPA for regulatory applications.
